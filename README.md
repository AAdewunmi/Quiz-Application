# Project Title:

Python quiz application

## 1. What is the project?

Python programming language quiz application for the terminal.

In this step-by-step project, we’ll build a terminal application that can quiz you and your friends on a range of topics
revolving around Python programming language.

First you get a set of questions. Then, for each question, you’ll choose an answer from a set of alternatives. Some questions may have multiple correct answers. You can access a hint to help you along the way. After answering a question, you’ll read an explanation that can provide more context for the answer.

## 2. Tech Stack:

- Python 3
- tomli 2.0.1 
- TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language)

⭐️ tomllib: You will need Python 3.11 installed to use the tomllib module.
```
$ pip install tomllib
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tomllib (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tomllib
```

## 3. What is the MVP?
The minimal viable product is an application that renders in a console, which allows users to ask questions and get answers.

## 4. What are the sprinkles? 
The sprinkles for this project is a Graphical User Interface for the application.

## 5. When will the project be complete? 
The project will be complete once all the MVP features have been implemented.
